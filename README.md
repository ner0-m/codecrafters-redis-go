This is my implementation of ["Build Your Own Redis"
Challenge](https://codecrafters.io/challenges/redis) using Go.

In this challenge, portions of the Redis protocol are implemented. It's a real fun
experience, and I used it both as a learning experience for Go and learning a
bit more about implementing protocols, handling messages and everything
involved!
